# TOP-odin-recipes

In this recipes project I've practiced the last lessons that the curriculum covers such as: 
## working with text (headers, paragrahps, bold, italic)
## working with links and images; also a good practice to keep the links secure
## working with lists
## and how to better organize the web to be easy to work with
